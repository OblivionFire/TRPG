Due to two bad colds nothing has happened for two weeks.
Week one will take place starting now.
Finals is also in a few days, plus I start the mentorship right after that. I am unsure as to how much I will actually be able to work on this,
But my goal that I am really going to try and force my self to is 5 time a week for atlest 30 min.
I also hope to stay on school time over the weekends
